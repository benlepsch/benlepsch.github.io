                <p>
                    I used to play a game called Papi Trampoline, but when I switched to using a laptop with linux I couldn't run it anymore.
                    This made me sad, so I wrote a clone called bean jump and put it online so it would work with any operating system. The above
                    picture shows four people from my high school all playing bean jump in class.

                <h4>Ring</h4>
                <img class="small_image" src="images/ring.jpg" alt="a ring i made">
                <p>
                    One of my friends and I wanted to make rings, so we did. This is the one I made. We started with a large steel bolt and 
                    cut it into pieces with an angle grinder, then heated each piece and hammered it down flat into a disc. We then drilled 
                    and filed out the inside until it fit, and then sanded the outside until it looked like a ring.

                <h4>Truck</h4>
                <img class="small_image" src="images/truck.JPG" alt="my truck">
                <p>
                    My grandfather had this truck when he lived in Charlottesville, but when he moved away he left it for my dad to use. It
                    was burning oil and leaking coolant into the oil and a whole bunch of other problems so this past summer I rebuilt the 
                    engine.
